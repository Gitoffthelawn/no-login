## Mozilla

This folder contains all the texts on the [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org) webpage for this add-on, such as the description, privacy policy, etc.

It needs to be synchronized manually. So if a contributor would like to modify how the extension looks like in the Mozilla store,
they can modify the content in this folder and submit a pull request. The author of the add-on will then update the content in the Mozilla store.
